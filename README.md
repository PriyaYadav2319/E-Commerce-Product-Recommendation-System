 Introduction:
This project analyzes user behavior on an ecommerce platform using demographic and behavioral data to provide actionable insights and recommendations. The analysis focuses on user demographics, preferences, and purchasing patterns to optimize engagement and sales strategies.  

 Key Features  
 Data Preprocessing:  
   Cleaned and standardized the dataset.  
   Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.  
   Scaled features with StandardScaler for improved model performance.  

 Data Visualization:  
   Scatter plots and heatmaps to identify correlations between features.  
   Distribution analysis of user income and product preferences.  

 Recommendation System:  
   Implemented itembased collaborative filtering and logistic regression for product recommendations.  

 Machine Learning Model:  
   Used Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict purchasing behavior.  
   Evaluated model accuracy using metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.  

 Dynamic Query System:  
   Developed a flexible query system to answer questions like:  
     "Which age group has the highest purchases?"  
     "What is the ranking of product categories based on total purchases?"  

 Dataset  
The dataset contains information on user demographics, purchase behavior, and engagement metrics:  
 Demographics: Age, Gender, Location, Income, Interests.  
 Behavioral Data: Purchase frequency, Total spending, Product category preferences.  
 Engagement Metrics: Time spent on site, Pages viewed, Newsletter subscription.  

 Methodology  
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:  
    Handled missing values and standardized data.  
    Engineered new features like `purchased`, `visitor`, and `bought_count`.  

2. Data Analysis and Insights:  
    Grouped and aggregated data by age, gender, location, and product category.  
    Visualized patterns using charts and heatmaps.  

3. Machine Learning Models:  
    Trained SVM to classify purchasing behavior based on features like Age, Income, and Total Spending.  
    Achieved a classification accuracy of 54%.  

4. Recommendations and Future Steps:  
    Explored advanced techniques like collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.  
    Suggested hyperparameter tuning and additional feature engineering for model improvement.  

 Results  
 Identified key purchasing trends based on age, gender, and location.  
 Highlighted top product categories like Electronics and Apparel for targeted marketing.  
 Suggested improvements in user engagement and sales strategies.  

 Visualization Highlights  
 Heatmaps for feature correlations.  
 Bar charts showing purchasing patterns across age groups and product categories.  
 Pie charts depicting locationbased spending trends.  

 Future Enhancements  
 Implement matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for advanced recommendations.  
 Integrate machine learning models for predictive analysis of user behavior.  
 Expand data collection to include detailed metrics like clickstream data and cart abandonment rates.
